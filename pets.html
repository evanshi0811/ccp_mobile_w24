            <img src="images/rocket_primary.jpg" width = "400" alt="Cute, small and yellow pomeranian">
            <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p> 
            <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will 'say hi' to you after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</p>

            <h2>Chako</h2>
            <img src="images/Chako1.jpg" width = "400" alt="Black and Tan color Shiba Inu">

            <p>With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, he seemed to embody both the mystery and the exuberance of life itself. Agile and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were his personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity.</p> 
            <p>Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. He would curl up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, as if solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene, Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities, teaching his human companions that one could be many things all at once.</p>
